A tiddler is the fundamental object of TiddlyWiki. They act as the pages of the wiki, but they're also a lot more versatile in ways you'll learn as you get to know ~TiddlyWiki. For now, thinking of them as pages is fine, especially since tiddlers translate directly to the [[pages|Page]] that appear in your generated Cyoa story. (e.g. The tiddler "My First Adventure" would become the "My First Adventure" page in your story.)
