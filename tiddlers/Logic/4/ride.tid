This page does something noteworthy.

In theory, there's no reason why the reader can't ride the carnival rides over and over. That would mean the reader could click on the "{{!!cyoa.caption}}" link more than once, but doing so would result in the //exact// same page presentation each time. The reader might not realize anything happened at all, and they might think the story is broken. This is bad.

Instead, this page is "first only", and you'll see that [[Logic4/actions]] actually resets this. What this does is it makes it so that the link can be clicked many times, but //not twice in a row//. At least one other thing has to happen between carnival rides. This way, no repeat pages.

This works because pages and nodes perform their touches and resets after all their interal content is process. So <<plink Logic4/actions>> resets this page only after it's rendered its <<wlink OptionsWidget>> once without it.

Now that you're small enough, you go outside the tent and enjoy the rollercoaster rides. It's great fun, and you return to the tent exhausted. Somehow, a day has passed, yet it seems like only a few hours have. It all seemed like a blur.
