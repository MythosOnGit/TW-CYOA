/**
This is the stylesheet for this demo. As it's tagged with $:/tags/cyoa/Stylesheet, it will be copied into the interactive novel as embedded CSS rather than as a page.

You may notice that it's represented in TiddlyMap as a red square. This is not automatic. I've manually configured it to look different from pages because I like to differentiate my CSS from my pages. You don't even have to have your CSS on your graph at all if you want.

See Style2/yard for instructions on how to style graph nodes.
