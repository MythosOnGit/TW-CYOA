Upstairs there are three beds. Judging from their different sizes, a family lives here. The first bed you try is the largest, and it's just fine, because how can a bed possibly be "too large"?

You lie down, confident that this is the end of your adventure, and nothing bad will come of your trespass. Congratulations on finishing your adventure.

Also, it's very red in here too.

<<annotate """

You'll notice that this page and also [[Style2/house/porridge]] have different-colored nodes in TiddlyMap. Unlike with [[Style2/yard]], this isn't manually set per page, but rather by custom node-type <<page Style2/house>>. If you'd like, you can edit existing node types or create your own by going to "<span class="tmap-unicode-icon">â–¢</span>&#32;Manage node-types"  in ~TiddlyMap's
<$button>{{$:/core/images/menu-button}}</$button>
menu.

''However, be aware.'' Adding background colors or borders to sets of nodes may override <<plugin>>'s behavior to style nodes based on their page set or constraints.
