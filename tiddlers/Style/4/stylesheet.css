/*
This is the stylesheet for this demo. As it's tagged with $:/tags/cyoa/Stylesheet, it will be copied into the interactive novel as embedded CSS rather than as a page.

You may notice that it's represented in TiddlyMap as a red square. This is not automatic. I've manually configured it to look different from pages because I like to differentiate my CSS from my pages. You don't even have to have your CSS on your graph at all if you want.

See Style2/yard for instructions on how to style graph nodes.

/*
This configures the interactive novel's encompassing <body> element to be forest green if the current leading page is "Style2/yard".
*/
.cyoa-body[data-title="Style2/yard"] {
    background-color: forestgreen;
}

/*
This sets all links on the page to be khaki, because the light blue is too hard to read against green.
*/
.cyoa-body[data-title="Style2/yard"] a {
    color: khaki;
}

/*
This style is a little different. It will apply in ALL cases where the leading title STARTS with "Style2/house/".
*/
.cyoa-body[data-title^="Style2/house/"] {
    background-color: firebrick;
    color: white;
}

/*
Again, this is just easier to red against firebrick.
*/
.cyoa-body[data-title^="Style2/house/"] a {
    color: lightblue;
}
