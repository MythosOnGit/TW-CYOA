[[Pages|Page]] and [[Active Nodes|Active Node]] are all evaluated by the <<plugin>> engine, and they'll evaluate to ''true'' or ''false'' (or ''ready'' or ''not ready'' to be displayed) depending on constraints attached to them.

If a page or an active node doesn't have any constraints, then it will always evaluate to true.

! Pages

Constraints that apply to pages are done through fields and the {{Buttons/edit-template}} of their corresponding tiddlers. For instance, if a page's "Show only" is set to "first", then the page will only evaluate to ''true'' if it is [[untouched|Tracking]].

Pages that evaluate to false will be passed over in [[append lists|Appending]] and will be hidden if listed in <<wlink OptionsWidget>> widgets. However, [[Hard Links]] which point to a false page will still be visible and interactable.

! Active nodes

Active nodes can be assigned constraints through their attributes. A widget such as `<$first after="OtherTiddler">...</$first>` will only evaluate to ''true'' if the containing tiddler is ''untouched'', and if ''OtherTiddler'' is ''touched''.

See [[this page|Active Node]] for more information.
