* Added color palette selector and a new tutorial to walk users through that. Hopefully no one will have to resort to CSS anymore to get the colors they want.
* There's a hidden "cyoatheme" manager in place too, but I only have one theme. Once I have more themes, I'll make this visible. If you're any good at making simple themes, let me know. I'm not.
