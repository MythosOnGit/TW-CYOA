A Page Run is the sequence of [[pages|Page]] which can be shown together in the generated cyoa. Page runs are created through [[Appending]], and depending on the constraints of the pages, may include different combinations of pages depending on the story's state.

There is no limit to how long a page run can be, however, no page can appear in a page run more than once.
