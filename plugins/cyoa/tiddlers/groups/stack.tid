description: The stack is a magic group used by the `cyoa.push` mechanism. Tiddlers cannot be added to this group, because //all// tiddlers are already in this group. //Any// tiddler can be pushed to the stack with the 'cyoa.push' title field. Any tiddler on the top of the stack will be automatically picked in any append list or $options group, even if they would have tested false.
