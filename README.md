# TW-cyoa
TW-cyoa is a TiddlyWiki5 plugin for creating interactive stories, or Choose-Your-Own-Adventure stories.

It's visual and declarative interface doesn't require any programming knowledge to work. The story files generated by this plugin are standalone html files which will work with any modern browser, both desktop and mobile. It's entire game state is stored within the URI, so saving one's progress is as simple as bookmarking a page. No cookies, no save files, no mess.
